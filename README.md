# React + Vite - Project Template

My template for a fast set-up of new projects using React with Vite. Includes set-up and configuration for Vitest (testing), ESLint (linting) and Prettier (formatting). Uses npm.

Made for VSCode and also includes VSCode settings for auto-lint and auto-format on save.

## How to install

Use as project template and run and after cloning, run **npm install** to install dependencies.
